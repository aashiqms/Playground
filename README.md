# BubbleSort
Utility script that implements the bubble sort algorithm in JavaScript. The basic concept of bubble sort is switching values if the adjacent value is smaller. This loop continues recursively until no more values can be sorted.

It's important to note that bubble sort is not a practical method of sorting in the real world. This script was made as an exercise to codify logic and mathamatical algorithms. More like this to come!
